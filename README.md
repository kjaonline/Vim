# Initial Setup
Install vim or neovim then run the command below.

`ln -s -f ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc && sudo ln -s ~/dotfiles/includes/* ~/.vim && mkdir ~/.vim/undodir`

# Goals
I am currently learning vim and use vim plugin in vscode. I would love to eventually migrate everything to terminal vim.

- ~Learn Vim motions~ (done)
- ~Use vim keybinds in vscode~ (done)
- Create .vimrc (in progress)
- Learn fzf, Nerd Tree and moving through different files
- Use vim terminal full time
- Throw mouse in trash
